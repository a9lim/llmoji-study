#
# v3 was originally written assuming a single MODEL_ID. To replicate v3
# on Qwen3.6-27B and (later) Ministral without forking the four v3
# entry-point scripts, we register per-model output paths here and
# select between them via $LLMOJI_MODEL. Default ("gemma") preserves
# every existing path bit-for-bit.
#
# v1/v2 paths are NOT model-keyed — those experiments are gemma-only
# because saklas has no steering-vector calibration for qwen3_5 or
# Ministral-3-8B. Adding model entries for them here is harmless;
# v1/v2 scripts simply ignore the registry.
